# ML-Simple-Linear-Regression

Import insurance.csv into your notebook.

● Use the data in the relevant columns to determine how age affects
insurance costs:

○ Plot a scatter plot with age on the x-axis and charges on the y-axis.
○ Using linear_model.LinearRegression() from sklearn, fit a model to
your data, and make predictions on data.
○ Plot another scatter plot with the best-fit line.

● Now repeat the above using the data in the relevant columns to determine
how BMI affects insurance costs.
